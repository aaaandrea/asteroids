# Asteroids

### Goals
This project is meant to work through Webpack installation, testing JavaScript code using window.x = x, and render information from JavaScript objects on a page. It uses Canvas.js to draw objects.

see [build notes](https://github.com/adelrio1/asteroids/blob/master/docs/build_notes.md) for walkthrough on how to build this yourself, or insight on how this was built. You will also find future thoughts on what should be added there.
